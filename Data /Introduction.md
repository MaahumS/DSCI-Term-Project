# Introduction to Case Project

In this project, my group will create a regression model to predict an individual's insurance premium price based on the individuals medical history. 
This case will provide valuable insights into how certain predictors impact premium costs, allowing for more informed decision-making by both individuals and insurance firms.
This analysis could also highlight disparities in premium pricing and give individuals an opportunity to advocate for more equitable treatment. 

## Variables 
Target variable: Insurance premium price 

Predictors included in our dataset are
- Age,
- Height
- Weight
- Diabetes
- Blood pressure problems
- Transplants
- Chronic Disease
- Known Allergies
- History of cancer in family
- Number of major surgeries

## Project Overview 
There are 986 observations in our dataset. We will start by using Excel and Tableau to create data visualizations. 
The data visualizations will help us determine which variables affect and do not affect our target variable. This will guide our feature selection. 
Secondly, we will use rapid miner to build and evaluate the model. 
We plan to use Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and Random Forest techniques. 
70% of the dataset will be used as a training model and the remaining 30% of the dataset will be used to validate our model's performance.
